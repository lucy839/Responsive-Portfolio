                <p>
                    Hello, My name is Lucy Lee. <br>
                    I'm originally from South Korea, and studied Biology at University of Washington. <br>
                    I was in the process of becoming pharmacist; therefore working as a pharmacy technician. <br>
                    However, computer field caught my eyes especially in web development area, and <br>
                    made me join UW BOOT CAMP - full stack program.<br>
                    I'm currently learning basic web development, and <br>
                    I will try my best to build up on it, so that I can be a competitve and unique developer. <br>
                    I know this webpage does not look fancy and perfect yet, but be prepared to see how much I will improve throughout this course! <br>
                </p>
